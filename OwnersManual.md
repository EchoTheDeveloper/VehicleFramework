# Atrama Construction Vehicle Owner's Manual

## Building your own
Build at a Mobile Vehicle Bay. It should be quite expensive.

### Getting inside
The hatch is on top.

## Powering it up
It can hold 4 power cells.

## Piloting 
It controls like a seamoth.

### Auto-leveling
Double-tap the auto-level (change this to exit) button to automatically level out the ship. This is useful because one cannot exit the pilot seat unless the ship is level.

## Manipulating the Arms
Only one arm may be operated at a time. Each arm has four joints. Each joint can move in two directions.

While piloting, each arm can be activated like a Perimeter Defense System module.

The arms may also be piloted from the exterior.
