The ACV can be unlocked by **TODO**

The ACV is built at a Mobile Vehicle Bay. It is quite expensive:
- Titanium Ingot x 1
- Plasteel Ingot x 1
- Lubricant      x 1
- Advanced Wiring kit x 1
- Lead x 2
- Enameled glass x 2
- Computer ? for auto-pilot ?

## Power
The ACV supports the use of 4 distinct power cells.

### Power Drains (in order of cost)
- Maneuvering the ship
- Manipulating the arms
- Exterior Lights
- Auto-pilot
- Interior Lights

## Vehicle Operation
There are several modes of operation.
- At the pilot seat
- At the interior control panel
- At the exterior control panel

### Piloting
It controls like a seamoth, but you cannot stop piloting while the ship is not level. You can use the **Auto-level** feature either by double-tapping the exit button or tapping the auto-level button.

### Interior Control Panel
Here are found a number of controls.
- Master Lights Toggle
- Power Toggle
- **Auto-pilot**

### Exterior Control Panel
Here you can find controls for the arms. 
There is also a place for a backup battery to be installed. 
The backup battery will **only** be used to auto-level the ship.

## Auto-leveling
There are two types of auto-leveling:
- **Activated Auto-leveling** is when you choose to start an auto-level as the pilot. Press the **auto-level button** to level out the pitch and roll of your ACV. 
- **Passive Auto-leveling** is when the ship starts an auto-level without your input. This will happen whenever the powered, unpiloted ship is not level. If the ACV experiences a collision while attempting to auto-level, it will cancel the auto-level and try again in 5 seconds.

## Auto-pilot
The auto-pilot screen will show you a map. You can choose a destination on that map. Your ACV should take you to that destination, near the surface of the ocean.

To use auto-pilot, several conditions must be met.
- The ACV is powered on.
- There are no obstacles between the ACV and the ocean surface.
- The auto-pilot can determine a path.

Upon starting the auto-pilot, the ACV will rise near to the surface. 
Once near the surface, the auto-pilot will maintain the same depth for the remainder of the trip. 
The auto-pilot will then attempt to move directly to the destination. 
If there is an obstacle in the way, the auto-pilot will attempt to go around it. 
But if there are obstacles in all directions of the plane, the auto-pilot will terminate itself. 
You can also press the auto-pilot button at any time to disengage the auto-pilot. 

## Manipulating the Arms
Only one arm may be operated at a time. Each arm has four joints. Each joint can move in two directions.

While piloting, each arm can be activated like a Perimeter Defense System module.

While active, the arms will supercede movement controls.

The arms have some automatic controls.

The arms may also be piloted using the Exterior Control Panels.
